# roll_dice_app

As a Flutter developer, I recently noticed that a new version of Flutter has been released. To refresh my knowledge, I decided to go through the old Flutter course but updated. To put this into practice, I created a simplistic and dummy application.

## Getting Started

Dice Roll Flutter App: Experience the excitement of rolling dice with a simple tap! This Flutter-powered mobile app generates a random number from 1 to 6 and displays the corresponding dice face image. Perfect for games and decision-making. Smooth, intuitive, and fun! ðŸŽ²ðŸ“± #Flutter #DiceRoll
